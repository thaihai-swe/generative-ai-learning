      "content": "Based on the provided sources, Einstein contributed significantly to quantum theory. \n\nAccording to [Source 1 - WIKIPEDIA], he played a major role in developing quantum theory, beginning with his 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect.\n\nAdditionally, as mentioned in [Source 2 - WIKIPEDIA], Einstein introduced the photon concept and inspired the notion of wave\u2013particle duality in quantum mechanics through his work on quantization of light. \n\nFurthermore, according to [Source 3 - WIKIPEDIA], he proposed a model of matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator, which demonstrated that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics.\n\nThese contributions demonstrate Einstein's significant impact on the development of quantum theory.",
